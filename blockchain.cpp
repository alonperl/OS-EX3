 * with an error otherwise).
 * RETURN VALUE: On success 0, otherwise -1.

/*
 * DESCRIPTION: Ultimately, the function adds the hash of the data to the Block chain.
 * Since this is a non-blocking package, your implemented method should return as soon as possible, even before the Block was actually attached 
 * to the chain.
 * Furthermore, the father Block should be determined before this function returns. The father Block should be the last Block of the current    
 * longest chain (arbitrary longest chain if there is more than one).
 * Notice that once this call returns, the original data may be freed by the caller.
 * RETURN VALUE: On success, the function returns the lowest available block_num (> 0),
 * which is assigned from now on to this individual piece of data.
 * On failure, -1 will be returned.

 * the Block. For clearance, this is opposed to the original add_block that adds the Block to the longest chain during the time that add_block    
 * was called.
 * The block_num is the assigned value that was previously returned by add_block. 
 * RETURN VALUE: If block_num doesn't exist, return -2; In case of other errors, return -1; In case of success return 0; In case block_num is 
 * already attached return 1.
